=head1 NAME

Devel::Datum::Cfg - Dynamic Debug Configuration Setting for Datum

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # In application's main
 use Devel::Datum qw(:all on);      # turns Datum "on" or "off"
 DLOAD_CONFIG(-file => "./debug.cf", -config => "config string");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By using DLOAD_CONFIG function in your application's main file, 
a debugging configuration can be dynamically loaded to define particular
level of debug/trace flags for specific sub-part of code.

For instance, the tracing can be turned off when entering in a routine of
a designated package. That is very useful to concentrate the debugging
onto the area that is presently developed and/or to filter some verbose
parts of code (recursive function call), when they don't require to be
monitored to fix a problem.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Before the obscure explaination of the grammar, here is an example of
what can be specified by dynamic configuration:

  /* 
   * flags definition: macro that can be used in further configuration
   * settings
   */
  flags common {
      all(yes);
      trace(yes): all;
  }

  flags silent {
      all(yes);
      flow(no);
      trace(no);
      return(no);
  }

  /*
   * default setting to use when there is no specific setting 
   * for the area
   */
  default common;


  /*
   * specific settings for specific areas
   */
  routine "context", "cleanup"                 { use silent; }
  routine "validate", "is_num", "is_greater"   { use silent; }

  file "Keyed_Tree.pm"                         { use silent; }
  file "Color.pm" {
      use silent; 
      trace(yes): emergency, alert, critical;
  }

  cluster "CGI::MxScreen" {
      use silent; 
      assert(no);
      ensure(no);
  }

  /*
   * aliasing to reduce the trace output line length
   */

  alias "/home/dehaudtc/usr/perl/lib/site_perl/5.6.0/CGI" => "<PM>";

=head1 INTERFACE

The only user interface is the C<DLOAD_CONFIG> routine, which expects
the following optional named parameters:

=over 4

=item C<-config> => I<string>

Give an inlined configuration string that is appended to the one
defined by C<-file>, if any.

=item C<-file> => I<filename>

Specifies the configuration file to load to initialize the
debugging and tracing flags to be used for this run.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES

=head2 Main Configuration Directives

The following main directives can appear at a nesting level of 0.  The
syntax unit known as I<BLOCK> is a list of semi-colon terminated directives
held within curly braces.

=over 4

=item C<alias> I<large_path> => I<short_path>

Defines an alias to be used during tracing.  The I<large_path> string
is replaced by the I<short_path> in the logs.

For instance, given:

  alias "/home/dehaudtc/lib/CGI" => "<CGI>";

then a trace for file C</home/dehaudtc/lib/CGI/Carp.pm> would be
traced as coming from file C<E<lt>CGIE<gt>/Carp.pm>, which is nicer to read.

=item C<cluster> I<name1>, I<name2> I<BLOCK>

The I<BLOCK> defines the flags to be applied to all named clusters.
A cluster is a set of classes under a given name scope.
Cluster names are given by strings withing double quotes, as in:

    cluster "CGI::MxScreen", "Net::MsgLink" { use silent; }

This would apply to all classes under the "CGI::MxScreen" or "Net::MsgLink"
name scopes, i.e. C<CGI::MxScreen::Screen> would be affected.

An exact match is attempted first, i.e. saying:

    cluster "CGI::MxScreen"         { use verbose; }
    cluster "CGI::MxScreen::Screen" { use silent; }

would apply the I<silent> flags for C<CGI::MxScreen::Screen> but the I<verbose>
ones to C<CGI::MxScreen::Tie::Stdout>.

=item C<default> I<name>|I<BLOCK>.

Specifies the default flags that should apply.  The default flags can be
given by providing the I<name> of flags, defined by the C<flags> directive,
or by expansing them in the following I<BLOCK>.

For instance:

    default silent;

would say that the flags to apply by default are the ones defined by an
earlier C<flags silent> directive.  Not expansing defaults allows for
quick switching by replacing I<silent> with I<verbose>.  It is up to you
to define what you mean by that though.

=item C<file> I<name1>, I<name2> I<BLOCK>

The I<BLOCK> defines the flags to be applied to all named files.
File names are given by strings withing double quotes, as in:

    file "foo.pm", "bar.pm" { use silent; }

This would apply to all files named "foo.pm" or "bar.pm", whatever their
directory, i.e. it would apply to C</tmp/foo.pm> as well as C<../bar.pm>.

An exact match is attempted first, i.e. saying:

    file "foo.pm"      { use verbose; }
    file "/tmp/foo.pm" { use silent; }

would apply the I<silent> flags for C</tmp/foo.pm> but the I<verbose>
ones to C<./foo.pm>.

=item C<flags> I<name> I<BLOCK>

Define a symbol I<name> whose flags are described by the following I<BLOCK>.
This I<name> can then be used in C<default> and C<use> directives.

For instance:

    flags common {
        all(yes);
        trace(yes): all;
    }

would define the flags known as I<common>, which can then be re-used, as in:

    flags other {
        use common;         # reuses definiton of common flags
        panic(no);          # but switches off panic, enabled in common
    }

A flag symbol must be defined prior being used.

=item C<routine> I<name1>, I<name2> I<BLOCK>

The I<BLOCK> defines the flags to be applied to all named routines.
Routine names are given by strings withing double quotes, as in:

    routine "foo", "bar" { use silent; }

This would apply to all routines named "foo" or "bar", whatever their package,
for instance C<main::foo> and C<x::bar>.

=head2 Debugging and Tracing Flags

Debugging (and tracing) flags can be specified only within syntactic I<BLOCK>
items, as expected by main directives such as C<flags> or C<file>.

Following is a list of debugging flags that can be specified in the
configuration.  The order in which they are given in the file is significant:
the I<yes>/I<no> settings are applied sequentially.

=over 4

=item C<use> I<name>

Uses flags defined by a C<flags> directive under I<name>.  It acts as a
recursive macro expansion (since C<use> can also be specified in C<flags>).
The symbol I<name> must have been defined earlier.

=item flow(yes|no)

Whether to print out the entering/exiting of routines. That implies the
invocation of the C<DFEATURE> function in the routines.

=item return(yes|no)

Whether to print out the returned when using the return
C<DVAL> and C<DARY> routines.

=item trace(yes|no)

Whether to print out traces specified by the C<DTRACE> function. By 
default all trace levels are affected.  It may be followed by a list
of trace levels affected by the directive, as in.

    trace(yes): emergency, alert, critical;

Trace levels are purely conventional, and have a strict one-to-one mapping
with C<DTM_TRC_> levels given at the C<DTRACE> call.  They are further
described in L<Trace Levels> below.  There is one bit per defined trace
level, contrary to the convention established by syslog(), for better
tuning.

=item require(yes|no)

Whether to evaluate the pre-condition given by C<DREQUIRE>.  But see
L<Assertion Evaluation Note> below.

=item assert(yes|no)

Whether to evaluate the assertion given by C<DASSERT>.  But see
L<Assertion Evaluation Note> below.

=item ensure(yes|no)

Whether to evaluate the post-condition given by C<DENSURE>.  But see
L<Assertion Evaluation Note> below.

=item panic(yes|no)

Whether to panic upon an assertion failure (pre/post condition or 
assertion).  If not enabled, a simple warning is issued, tracing the
assertion failure.

=item stack(yes|no)

Whether to print out a stack trace upon assertion failure.

=item all(yes|no)

Enable or disables B<all> the previously described items.

=back

=head2 Assertion Evaluation Note

When C<Devel::Datum> is switched off, the assertions are always monitored,
and any failure is fatal.  This is because a failing assertion is a bad thing
in production mode, and also because since C<DREQUIRE> and friends are not
C macros but routines, the assertion expression is evaluated anyway, so we
might as well test it.

Therefore, a directive like:

    require(no);

will only turn off monitoring of pre-conditions in debugging mode (e.g. because
the interface is not finalized, or the clients do not behave properly yet).

=head2 Trace Levels

Here is the list of trace flags that can be specified by the configuration:

    Configuration    DTRACE flag
    -------------    -------------
              all    TRC_ALL
        emergency    TRC_EMERGENCY
            alert    TRC_ALERT
         critical    TRC_CRITICAL
            error    TRC_ERROR
          warning    TRC_WARNING
           notice    TRC_NOTICE
             info    TRC_INFO
            debug    TRC_DEBUG

You can say something like:

    trace(no): all;
    trace(yes): emergency, alert, critical, error;

Since flags are applied in sequence, the first directive turns all tracing
flags to off, the second enables only the listed ones.
